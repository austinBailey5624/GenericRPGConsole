In the beggining you are in a nice farming village with your family, your dad has you do chores that act as a 
tutorial, teaching you how to act in the game - go to a local shop, buy some bread, heres a stick go kill the beetles
that have infested the yard, etc. Then when your chores are done, you go to bed and fall asleep. You are woken up by 
fire as a dragon attacks killing everyone, your mother shields you with your body so you are mostly unhurt.

A passing caravan sees the smoke and takes you to the earl who sees your potential and allows you to train in
the barracks to become a soldier.
